# Nebula-CSS & React + ES6 + Webpack Starter Project

## Get Started
1. fork / clone this repository
2. `npm install` OR `yarn`
3. `npm start` OR `yarn start` to start the Webpack Development Server
4. `npm run build` OR `yarn build` for production build

**Note** This is a very minimal starter pack, you are encouraged to add in your
own preferred unit testing framework. If you are importing images or SVGs you
will require the appropriate Webpack-loaders, the same goes for webfonts etc.

As is Babel and Autoprefixer are configured to support the following browser environments:
```
"last 2 versions", "ie 9-11"
```
These can be re-configured in your `.babelrc` and `webpack-config.babel` files.
